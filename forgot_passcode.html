        <p>Your conversations wouldn't be secure if there was a backdoor, so we didnâ€™t create one. Only you can read your messages.</p>
        <p><b>If you forgot Passcode,</b> you will need to clear the app data and go through the setup process again, to reset your passcode. You can do this by uninstalling and re-installing the app, or going through your system settings.</p>
